# Find a recipe based off of ingredients you own!

## As a reminder...
At a grocery store, everything looks good to eat. When it comes time to make a meal, it is difficult to come up with a recipe. There are many websites that will give you a recipe if you know what you want, but there is no application to find a recipe based off of ingredients that you already own. This application would go find a recipe based off of ingredients that a person has in their pantry/fridge.

## 1. What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
This idea is not original, it's been done multiple times from places like [Supercook](https://www.supercook.com/#/recipes) or [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/pantry-recipe-finder-article). From the look and feel of SUpercook, it has been actively developed upon for a while and I believe this team can make something up to or past the standards of SUpercook. There are not hundreds of applications that do this, and the few that are there I feel could be better. 
i.e Already having a meal(s) planned out based off of what was bought at the store, alerting when a meal needs to be made due to an ingredient about to expire etc. 

## 2. Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
This idea is worth doing because it is exciting for anyone who sits there staring at their fridge going "Dang, I gotta make dinner again and I have no idea what to make". A utility such as this would be incredibly useful, and exciting to implement due to it's range of features that would make it iteratively better. 

## 3. What are a few major features?
1. Curate a list of recipes based off what is currently in an inventory of ingredients
2. Find Recipes based from name
3. Automatically decrement ingredients from inventory when they are used
4. Show nutrition information of the recipe 
5. Be able to manually decrement recipe ingredients
6. Auto generate a menu for the week with ingredients that need to be picked up or are already in the inventory
7. Generate a shopping list with all ingredients for upcoming meals. 

## What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
As far as algorithms go, one must be used to compare the data to what is used in the recipe. Another algorithm will have to be used to decrement the ingredients that are in the fridge/pantry after the recipe is selected. These decremented ingredients will be stored in persistent storage to be used later in a different recipe. There will have to be a way to delete these old ingredients in case they expire or are used up without telling the app.

## 6. Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.
For difficulty the project would be rated around a 7 to 8 with room to add more complex features as the project becomes more fleshed out. It would utilize everything learned in the class so far, as well as meeting the requirements of the project. Requiring external API calls, a robust database, and a functional, user-friendly front-end.
