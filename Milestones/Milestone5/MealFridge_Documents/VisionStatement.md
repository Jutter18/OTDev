## Recipe finder vision statement
<p>
    As OnTrack Development, we will strive to create a platform, MealFridge, for people who are uncertain about what to make for dinner, given what they currently have. MealFridge will provide individuals with what to make for a meal, based off of items that they already have, in addition to other factors such as dietary restrictions or favorite meals or cuisines. These recipes should also be searchable by name, type, or other specified filters. The system will store the users current inventory as well as the individual's preferences. These preferences will include what the person dislikes as well as any dietary accommodations that must be made. If an inventory does not contain enough ingredients or the individual wants to make an entire menu for any amount of days a shopping list will be automatically be generated. Unlike the current applications, our application will accommodate a menu, shopping list, and both types of searches (by inventory and by name), with focuses on budget and limiting shopping trips.
