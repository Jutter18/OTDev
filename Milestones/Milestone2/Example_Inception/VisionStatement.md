For climbing enthusists who need to find information on expeditions, the Himalayan Database is
an information system that will provide a single hub for expeditions, trekking agencies, 
climbing news, and more. The system will store information on Trekking Agencies, Expeditions, Peaks, and Climbers,
with details such as whether a peak has be climbed before, why an expedition was cancelled, deaths, whether oxygen
was used and more. The system will allow vetted Agencies to submit their own expedition and climber information as
well to ensure the most up to date stats are availible.
