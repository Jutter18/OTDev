## What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? 


The approach to my idea is to incorporate similar algorithms and applications that rely on keywords and user information and cross references the same words among other users. This idea would include  club data similar to what is on WOU’s Engage but would be a more user friendly application that focuses on individual interests rather than organizations.There are other applications that may function similarly, but this idea is unique in that it builds upon the Engage system[a] in a different way and will be primarily used by WOU students.


## Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?


        This idea arose from my own experience here at WOU. New and transfer students can use this application to find other students with similar interests. This way a user can join or create something based on their interests rather than trying to find a club they would fit in with. 


## What are a few major features?


        Some of the major features this application would comprise is a database to hold information, both student and organization. An algorithm would need to be implemented to filter through the database to find information similar to another student in the event of a query. A calendar-like api of some sort would also be implemented to plan events, meet up times, etc. An account system that utilizes email confirmation would also need to be implemented in order to protect student information. There would also need to be an MVC framework to take in student information and display it accordingly.[b]


## What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? 


         We would  need to utilize a calendar api service, preferably one from Google, to implement our applications events feature. Additionally we could seek access to WOU’s club information via Engage to integrate the club information into our database, but could rely on student input if we are unable to.


## What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? 


        The algorithm required would be the largest part of our application. There needs to be an algorithm that compares different students or organizations and checks for similar interests. It seems relatively easy at first, but the algorithm would need to check for specific keywords. For example, if a student has an interest in “outdoors”, the algorithm would include many other activities the student may not be interested in. We would need to check for vagueness and specificity.


## Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10.
        
I would rate this project a 5 out of 10 on a difficulty scale. I think that compared to my peers’ ideas[c] that this is a moderate common ground. It requires a good portion of our skills involved in MVC, API’s, and databases but also leaves some breathing room to add any additional ideas that may arise in implementation. Also we would need some access to Engage to use their information, which may add some difficulty to the project. [d]
[a]Given that we might not have access to Engage itself for the project, probably best to leave it to student supplied info only, as Engage is not owned by the school but rather licensed I think.
[b]Feel like this is obvious, but probably doesn't hurt to include.
[c]I feel called out
[d]Not required, noted above
