My idea involves an improved and expanded approach to the WOU Engage system of finding clubs. The idea is that a new student to WOU can find a group of people, whether it is an organization or club, based on common interests. For example if a student is interested in hiking/outdoor activities, they could find others that are also interested/involved in these activities.The website would require a couple of things. First a student can have their own WOU account to login and access the site. A database would be used to store other clubs information. The student would enter/select a variety of topics that interest them, have it stored into the database, and an algorithm can find other students or clubs based on their interests, and display it to the student as well as the appropriate contact information.There are some APIs currently in use that we could use to create this site. One example of an api is found on https://nationbuilder.com/people_api. This one can help find other people based on keywords. Since the idea involves common interests rather than student data the api could work great.
